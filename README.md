# fresh-install
Install scripts for a fresh Windows install.

You may notice that this is a fork of nadia-moon's scripts. Well done! I changed out the package lists so it uses my personal package lists. Nadia's cool though. Go give money, yes?

This repo also includes an autounattend.xml file for maximum lazy. The default password is "hackme". Put this on a separate USB stick to your Windows installer in the root directory and plug both USBs in for maximum automation!
